### Structures
1. 14DTE Broken Wing Butterfly
    - Upper Long -> ATM
    - Shorts -> 40-50 pts below ATM
    - Lower Long -> 50-60 pts below shorts
    - 10-15 pt spread between debit and credit spreads 

2. 14DTE/21DTE Calender Spread (7 Day)
    - Profits from theta
    - Market moves up -> profits from delta
    - Volatility goes up -> tent widens

3. Details
    - Minimum Planned Capital $5,000 - $8,000 (2 lot trade)
    - Minimum Account Size $9,000 - $10,000 (2 lot trade)
        - Note: Will need $25K account to avoid PDT
    - Profit Target - 5% or more (2021 average 6.5%)
    - Losses - average around 6% (generally under 10% with occasional larger loss outlier)
    - Win / Loss Expectancy - 9 / 1

4. Entry
    - 14DTE on Friday Mornings (generally 1 hr after market opens)
    - All trades and adjustments are done using put options
    - Start with 1 lot 40/60 BWB as follows:
        - Choose ATM strike for the upper long strike (preferably the 10 pt strike closest to ATM)
        - Short strike is 40 points below the upper long strike 
        - Start with lower strike 60 points below the short strike 
        - Raise or lower the lower strike in order to make a 1 lot BWB delta slightly flat to slightly negative (I prefer a little negative). 
        - *NOTE:* if a 1 lot 40/60 BWB produces a very negative position delta (can happen in a low vol environment) then start with a 30/40 BWB. In addition you can adjust some of the short strikes up as well as the lower strike down to help flatten. If can't find a good setting then skip that week. 
    - Increase contract size to 2 lot or higher. For this workshop I will be using 10 lots.
